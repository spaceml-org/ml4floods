# About

ML4Floods is an open-source project funded by the United Kingdom Space Agency (UKSA) and led by [Trillium Technologies](http://trillium.tech/).
 The project is hosted in [GitHub](https://github.com/spaceml-org/ml4floods), it contains a python package with all the necessary tools for training and deploying flood extent
 segmentation models for Sentinel-2. These tools include: image downloading, flood map acquisition, neural network training, testing and the visualization of the results in an interactive map. 
 See the [introduction](./intro/introduction.md) for a more detailed explanation.
 
This work is an extension of the [FDL Europe 2019](https://fdleurope.org/) *"Disaster Prevention, Progress and Response"* team which results are published in:
 
 > G. Mateo-Garcia, J. Veitch-Michaelis, L. Smith, S. Oprea, G. Schumann, Y. Gal, Baydin G.A., Backes D.  [Towards global flood mapping onboard low cost satellites with machine learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-86650-z). _Scientific Reports 11, 7249_ (2021).
 
This work is also part of the [SpaceML](http://spaceml.org/). [SpaceML](http://spaceml.org/) contains a set of tools for *"building the Machine Learning (ML) infrastructure needed to streamline 
and super-charge intelligent applications, automation and robotics needed to explore deep space and better manage our planetary spaceship for mutual benefit"*.
