## Brief description
The ml4floods viewer and label editor is a Flask web application to view and manually edit the floodmaps of the *WorldFloods* dataset.
We use this application to keep growing *WorldFloods* and to improve the quality of its labels. In order to test it, you need
to [download the *WorldFloodsv2* dataset (at least a subset of it)](./worldfloods_dataset.md). 

To launch the viewer clone the package and run:

```bash
pip install flask ml4floods
git clone git@github.com:spaceml-org/ml4floods.git
cd ml4floods/viewer

python serve.py --root_location /path/to/localdir/WorldFloodsv2 --gt_version v2 --no_save_floodmap_bucket
```

The following video shows the viewer in action:
